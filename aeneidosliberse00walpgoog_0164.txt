The Helvetiae War end Iocasten es Britain heve proved
se useiul te these making the transition irem Latin grammar

to prese, that these little books are published ln the hope
that they may rendere similar service ln introducing the
study of Latin verse. A well-graded course in Virgil may
be arranged by reading the first book ol the AEaer‘d ln this
elementary ferm, and the second and third books as edlted
by Mr. Hewsen in the semewhat more advanced Classical
Series. These who would avoid this change oi editors may
prefer to'read ss introductery matter the Seleetteas from
Ovids Metamorphoses, which contains a number ei inter-
estingstories in easy Latin verse. It is therefore commended
te teaehers who consider Virgil too difficult ier a first verse
y taedet, and yet have little tium ier work thet ls net ‘⁶ re-
quired.'’ In the American edition the notes have been
rewritten‚ the vocabulary revlsed, and references added to
the grammars ef Allen and Greeneugh‚ Gildersleeve, and
Harkness.
